# Reinforcement_Learning
This is my first try at Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Step I
Using OpenAI Gym test a random environment
Create Deep Learning model using keras
Build agent with Keras RL
Reload agent from memory


The current DQN model is trained well and is able to gain 200 points on the CartPole-v0.
